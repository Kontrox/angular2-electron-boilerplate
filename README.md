# Angular 2 Boilerplate

An easy to use boilerplate for Angular 2 applications.

Features:
   - Typescript, SASS
   - Development server with browser-sync
   - Easy to use Gulp workflow

This was built in efforts to find an easy to use Typescript workflow, and at
an attempt to make a lightweight boilerplate without all of the additional
bloat. It can be assumed you know how to implement Angular 2, or are learning,
but setting up an easy to use build-system is non-trivial.

Running in development mode:
`npm start`
